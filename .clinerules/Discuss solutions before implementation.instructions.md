## Discuss solutions before implementation

Before implementing any solution, discuss the approach with other team members or contributors to ensure the solution addresses the right problem and considers all relevant use cases.

### The principle

No solution should be implemented in isolation. Every proposed solution must be discussed with others to validate the approach, identify potential issues, and ensure broader applicability.

### Why discussion is essential

- **Prevents tunnel vision:** Individual perspectives may miss important use cases
- **Validates problem scope:** Confirms the problem is worth solving
- **Improves solution quality:** Multiple viewpoints lead to better designs
- **Ensures consistency:** Aligns solutions with project standards and patterns

### When to discuss

**Always discuss:**

- New features or significant changes
- Solutions that affect multiple modules
- Changes to core systems or shared functionality
- Architectural decisions

**Discussion may be brief for:**

- Bug fixes with obvious solutions
- Minor improvements to existing functionality
- Changes with clear ownership and scope

### How to structure discussions

1. **Present the problem clearly:** Describe what users are experiencing
2. **Propose your solution:** Explain your approach and reasoning
3. **Ask specific questions:** Request feedback on particular aspects
4. **Consider alternatives:** Be open to different approaches
5. **Document the decision:** Record the agreed-upon approach

### Discussion channels

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** For significant decisions
- **Code reviews:** For implementation-level feedback
- **Team meetings:** For complex or controversial topics
- **Issue discussions:** For community input on public projects

### Benefits of discussion

- **Better solutions:** Multiple perspectives improve quality
- **Shared knowledge:** Team members learn from each other
- **Reduced rework:** Catching issues early prevents major changes later
- **Team alignment:** Everyone understands the direction and reasoning

### What to avoid

- **Implementation without discussion:** Skipping the conversation to save time
- **Defensiveness:** Being unwilling to consider alternative approaches
- **Analysis paralysis:** Discussing endlessly without making decisions
- **Dismissing concerns:** Ignoring valid feedback from team members

### Exception

The only exception is when working in an area with a clear, agreed-upon owner who has direct knowledge of user needs and full authority to make implementation decisions.

This collaborative approach leads to better solutions and stronger team alignment on technical decisions.
