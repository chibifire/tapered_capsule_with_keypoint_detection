## Elixir app readme

Each Elixir application within the umbrella project must have its own `README.md` file with clear documentation.

### The principle

Every application should be self-documenting with its own README that explains its purpose and usage.

### Required content

Each README file should include:

- **Clear description:** The application's purpose and functionality
- **Setup instructions:** How to set up and run the application  
- **Usage examples:** Basic usage patterns and examples
- **Developer information:** Any other relevant details for developers

### Implementation approach

1. **Create README per app:** Each umbrella app gets its own README
2. **Keep it current:** Update README when functionality changes
3. **Focus on essentials:** Include what developers actually need to know
4. **Use clear language:** Write for your future self and other developers

### Benefits

- **Self-documenting projects:** Each app explains itself
- **Faster onboarding:** New developers can understand each app quickly  
- **Better maintenance:** Clear documentation makes changes easier
- **Reduced support questions:** Good documentation prevents confusion

This follows the targeted solutions principle - each app solves specific problems and should document exactly what it does.
