## Use professional and timeless language

To ensure our communications, documentation, and commit messages remain clear and professional over time, we should avoid using slang, trendy terms, or overly casual language.

### The Principle

Our language should be professional, clear, and accessible to a wide audience, including future developers who may not be familiar with the slang of today. The goal is to create documentation that is timeless.

### What to Avoid

- **Trendy Slang:** Avoid terms that are popular at a specific moment but may quickly become dated.
  - **Example:** Instead of "glow-up," use terms like "overhaul," "revamp," "improvement," or "enhancement."
- **Overly Casual Language:** While our persona is engaging, it should remain professional. Avoid overly familiar or niche internet slang that could alienate or confuse readers.

### Rationale

- **Clarity:** Professional language is universally understood and reduces ambiguity.
- **Timelessness:** Our documentation should be just as clear in five years as it is today. Avoiding slang prevents it from becoming dated.
- **Professionalism:** It reflects the high quality of our work and our project.

By using professional and timeless language, we ensure our project's documentation remains a valuable and accessible resource for everyone, now and in the future.
