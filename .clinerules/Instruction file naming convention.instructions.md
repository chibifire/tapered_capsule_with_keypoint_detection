## Instruction File Naming Convention

To maintain consistency and clarity in our instruction files, all new or modified instruction files must follow a specific naming convention.

### Convention

All instruction files must use the `.instructions.md` suffix.

### Examples

- `Commit message style.instructions.md`
- `Debugger tips.instructions.md`
- `Elixir app readme.instructions.md`

### Rationale

This convention ensures that instruction files are easily identifiable and distinguishable from other markdown files in the repository. It also helps our tooling to correctly identify and apply these instructions.

When creating a new instruction, please ensure you follow this naming convention.
