## Instruction File Location

To maintain a centralized and organized set of project guidelines, all instruction files must be placed in the `.clinerules/` directory.

### Rationale

- **Centralization:** Keeping all instructions in a single, designated folder makes them easy to find, manage, and reference.
- **Discoverability:** New team members can quickly locate all project-specific instructions in one place.
- **Tooling:** This convention allows our tooling to reliably find and apply instructions across the workspace.

When creating a new instruction, please ensure it is placed in this directory.
