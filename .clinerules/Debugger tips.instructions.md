## Debugger tips

- Focus on single issues: Address one error or warning at a time
- Micro-batch when necessary: To avoid rate-limiting issues with GitHub Copilot, bundle a small number of related fixes into a single interaction
- Commit frequently: Apply fixes, commit changes, then repeat the process
- Exercise caution: Be mindful of opportunities to address multiple issues at once, but proceed carefully to avoid introducing new problems
