## Problem first approach

Before implementing any solution, feature, or enhancement, the problem must be clearly identified and documented first. This principle prevents unnecessary code and ensures focused development.

### What to avoid

- Solutions in search of problems: Creating features because they seem useful without identifying a specific problem
- Future proofing: Adding complexity to solve problems that might exist in the future
- Speculation-based development: Building features based on assumptions about what users might need

### Implementation approach

1. Document the problem first: Clearly describe the issue users are experiencing
2. Verify the problem exists: Confirm through user feedback, testing, or real-world scenarios
3. Assess problem scope: Determine if the problem is worth solving (complexity and frequency)
4. Design the minimal solution: Create the simplest implementation that solves the identified problem
