OBJECTIVE: Generate tapered capsule mesh geometry in Godot using PR 109009 primitive support.

RESPONSIBILITY: Transform MiniZinc3 solver output into Godot tapered capsule mesh primitives.

PROBLEM DEFINITION

MiniZinc3 solver provides abstract capsule parameters.

Godot requires mesh primitives for rendering and physics.

Tapered capsule primitive must support dual radii configuration.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Godot MeshInstance3D nodes with tapered capsule geometry.

Proper transformation matrices for position and orientation.

CSG-ready mesh topology for combination operations.
