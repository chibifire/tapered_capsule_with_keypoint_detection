MINIZINC3 CAPSULE OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM

OBJECTIVE: Generate optimal tapered capsule parameters using MiniZinc3 constraint solver.

RESPONSIBILITY: Transform 3D keypoints into tapered capsule geometry parameters with anatomical constraints.

PROBLEM DEFINITION

3D keypoints define joint positions but lack capsule dimensions.

Tapered capsules require position, orientation, length, and dual radii parameters.

Anatomical constraints must prevent unrealistic capsule configurations.

Optimization must balance volume coverage with geometric feasibility.

INPUT DATA

3D keypoint coordinates in VRM-compatible coordinate system.

Confidence scores for each keypoint position.

Japanese anthropometric data for constraint bounds.

VRM skeleton hierarchy for joint relationships.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Capsule position (X, Y, Z) for each bone segment.

Capsule orientation (rotation angles) aligned with bone hierarchy.

Capsule length matching bone segment distances.

Dual radii (R1, R2) for proximal and distal capsule ends.

CONSTRAINT VARIABLE DEFINITIONS

Position variables: X, Y, Z coordinates for each capsule center point.

Orientation variables: Rotation angles for capsule alignment with bone hierarchy.

Length variables: Distance between capsule end caps along Y axis.

Dual radii variables: R1 and R2 for proximal and distal capsule ends.

CONSTRAINT TYPES

Position constraints ensure capsules align with detected joint locations.

Orientation constraints enforce anatomically correct bone alignment using VRM hierarchy.

Length constraints derived from calculated VRM bone lengths scaled to subject.

Dual radii constraints ensure smooth tapering between joint connections.

Volume maximization constraint encourages complete coverage.

Overlap minimization constraint prevents capsule intersection.

Anatomical proportion constraints enforce realistic limb thickness ratios.

Symmetry constraints ensure left and right limb capsules maintain bilateral consistency.
