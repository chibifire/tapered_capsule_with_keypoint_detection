WEIGHT TRANSFER ALGORITHM SYSTEM

OBJECTIVE: Transfer skinning weights from original VRM mesh to tapered capsule geometry.

RESPONSIBILITY: Preserve animation capability by maintaining bone weight influences on capsule mesh.

PROBLEM DEFINITION

Original VRM mesh contains vertex skinning weights for skeleton deformation.

Tapered capsule mesh has different vertex topology and positions.

Weight transfer must preserve natural deformation characteristics.

Animation compatibility requires smooth weight transitions across capsule boundaries.

INPUT DATA

Preserved deformation characteristics matching original mesh behavior.

VRM-compatible weight format for export.

WEIGHT TRANSFER METHODS

Proximity-based interpolation using nearest vertex distances.
