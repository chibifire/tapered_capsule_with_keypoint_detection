# Fix for Hemisphere Winding Order in Tapered Capsule Generation

## Issue Description

Both the top and bottom hemispheres of tapered capsules generated by the `minizinc_to_gltf.py` script had incorrect winding order, causing the first layer of triangles to be inside out. This resulted in visual artifacts when rendering the capsules in 3D viewers.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the triangle index generation for connecting the cylinder top to the top hemisphere. The winding order of the triangles was inconsistent with the rest of the mesh, causing backface culling to hide the front faces and display the back faces instead.

## Solution

The fix involved correcting the winding order in the `generate_capsule_mesh` method in `minizinc_to_gltf.py`. We modified two sections:

1. The section that generates indices for connecting the cylinder top to the top hemisphere
2. The section that generates indices for connecting the bottom center to the first ring of the bottom hemisphere

### Top Hemisphere Fix

#### Before (incorrect winding order):
```python
# Connect cylinder top to top hemisphere
cylinder_top_ring = cylinder_rings * segments  # Last ring of cylinder
top_hemisphere_first_ring = top_hemisphere_start
for i in range(segments):
    next_i = (i + 1) % segments
    indices.extend([
        cylinder_top_ring + i, top_hemisphere_first_ring + next_i, top_hemisphere_first_ring + i
    ])
    indices.extend([
        cylinder_top_ring + i, cylinder_top_ring + next_i, top_hemisphere_first_ring + next_i
    ])
```

#### After (correct winding order):
```python
# Connect cylinder top to top hemisphere
cylinder_top_ring = cylinder_rings * segments  # Last ring of cylinder
top_hemisphere_first_ring = top_hemisphere_start
for i in range(segments):
    next_i = (i + 1) % segments
    indices.extend([
        cylinder_top_ring + i, top_hemisphere_first_ring + i, top_hemisphere_first_ring + next_i
    ])
    indices.extend([
        cylinder_top_ring + i, top_hemisphere_first_ring + next_i, cylinder_top_ring + next_i
    ])
```

### Bottom Hemisphere Fix

#### Before (incorrect winding order):
```python
# Connect bottom center to first ring of bottom hemisphere
for i in range(segments):
    next_i = (i + 1) % segments
    indices.extend([bottom_center_idx, bottom_hemisphere_start + next_i, bottom_hemisphere_start + i])
```

#### After (correct winding order):
```python
# Connect bottom center to first ring of bottom hemisphere
for i in range(segments):
    next_i = (i + 1) % segments
    indices.extend([bottom_center_idx, bottom_hemisphere_start + i, bottom_hemisphere_start + next_i])
```

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that all triangles in the capsule mesh follow a consistent winding order (counter-clockwise when viewed from the outside) which is required for proper backface culling in most 3D rendering systems.

The change affects the triangle definitions for:
1. Connecting the cylinder top ring to the top hemisphere first ring
2. Connecting the bottom center to the bottom hemisphere first ring

By reordering the vertex indices, we ensure that the normal vectors of these triangles point outward, making the surface visible from the outside.

## Verification

The fix has been verified by:
1. Running all existing tests to ensure no regressions
2. Generating a test capsule and visually inspecting it in a 3D viewer
3. Confirming that both the top and bottom hemispheres now render correctly with proper orientation

## Impact

This fix resolves the visual artifact where the hemispheres appeared inside out, ensuring that all capsules generated by the pipeline render correctly in 3D applications with proper winding order for both the top and bottom hemispheres.
